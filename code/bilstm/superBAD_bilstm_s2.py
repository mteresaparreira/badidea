                                            When making predictions using the trained model, the output is in the form of predicted probabilities,
                                            indicating the likelihood of each sample belonging to each target class.

                                            Predicted Probabilities (y_predict_probs):
                                            - Shape: (#samples, #target_classes)
                                            - Each value in y_predict_probs represents the probability of the corresponding sample being classified
                                            into the respective class.

                                            Converting Probabilities to Class Labels (y_predict):
                                            - The y_predict array is derived by finding the index of the maximum value along a specified axis.
                                            - It represents the predicted class label for each sample based on the highest predicted probability.
